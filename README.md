Introduction
------------
This is a WEB MIDI application, written in HTML5 and Javascript, that gives a single performer control over the performance of music scores displayed in a browser. It uses MIDI input and output devices, and scores stored in an SVG format which has been enhanced to contain MIDI information. The lastest stable version can be tried out on the web at<br />
http://james-ingram-act-two.de/open-source/assistantPerformer/assistantPerformer.html

This project is only being tested on the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox, and is not guaranteed to work in other browsers. Currently, Firefox can only be used if the <a href="http://jazz-soft.net">Jazz</a> plug-in is installed.<br />

Note that it is not possible to display or play scores unless a valid MIDI output device has been selected, but that only hardware or software devices that involve installing a plugin are currently supported.<br />
On Windows, the free [Virtual MIDI Synth](http://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth) can be installed and used in both browsers.<br />
The *Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth* (part of Windows) is only available in Firefox (which requires the Jazz plug-in).
